# Titanic-survival-prediction
Predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic is a classic machine learning problem often used for teaching and demonstration purposes. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features such as age, sex, ticket class, and others. Here's a detailed overview of how you can approach Titanic survival prediction using Python:

1. Data Collection:
You need a dataset containing information about Titanic passengers, including whether they survived or not. The dataset typically includes features such as:

Passenger ID
Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass (Ticket class: 1st, 2nd, or 3rd)
Name
Sex
Age
SibSp (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)
Parch (Number of parents/children aboard)
Ticket (Ticket number)
Fare (Passenger fare)
Cabin (Cabin number)
Embarked (Port of embarkation: C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
2. Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values: Fill in missing values or drop rows/columns with missing data.
Feature engineering: Create new features or modify existing ones to extract useful information.
Convert categorical variables: Encode categorical variables as numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Split the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (y).
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Understand the distribution of each feature.
Explore relationships between features and the target variable (Survived).
Visualize data using plots such as histograms, bar plots, box plots, and scatter plots.
4. Model Selection:
Choose a machine learning algorithm(s) to train on the dataset. Common algorithms for classification tasks like Titanic survival prediction include:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Gradient Boosting classifiers
5. Model Training:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the selected model(s) on the training data.
6. Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the performance of the trained model(s) using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score.
Use techniques like cross-validation to assess the model's generalization performance.
7. Hyperparameter Tuning:
Optimize the hyperparameters of the model to improve its performance using techniques like grid search or random search.

8. Prediction and Deployment:
Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
Deploy the model into a production environment where it can be used to predict survival on unseen data.
